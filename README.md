# Crowd Sensing Mobile Application for the Collection and Visualization of Environmental Pollution Data in Mexico
According to the Mexican Center for Environmental Law (CEMDA), Mexico has reached levels of pollution that are worrying for citizens. For example, more than 547,000 tons of carbon dioxide are discharged annually. However, data to corroborate the spatio-temporal distribution of environmental pollution within Mexico are often irregular, and are acquired from a dispersed distribution of few and very expensive monitoring stations, which also do not cover the entire country. For this reason, with the lower prices of smartphones that come with a variety of sensors, along with the intrinsic mobility of their users, an approach has been contemplated to acquire local data from people's immediate surroundings or even from themselves, these Data are indicators of people's health which will be collected daily using the crowd-sensing technique. Crowd sensing is an approach that involves a large, dispersed group of participants using mobile devices with the objective of receiving/sending reliable data from the field. So with this technique you can collect data without high investment costs since nowadays almost everyone brings a smartphone with them. With the participation of IPN students and staff, and other volunteer users dispersed throughout the country, who will have access to the application developed in this project, it will be possible to achieve a collection, interpretation and visualization of reliable distribution data in space and time of environmental pollution within Mexico with minimal investment.

### Goals and Objectives
#### General Objective
Develop a smart mobile application (cross-platform) that helps collect, process, and visualize environmental pollution data in real time.

##### Specific Objectives
The specific objectives for this project are:
* Design a three-tier architecture, namely: the data management and processing layer (MongoDB/MySQL and PyTorch), the service layer (NodeJS/Express; Firebase) and the presentation layer (Flutter).
* Establish all the necessary tools and dependencies for the frontend and backend.
* Build Front-End and Back-End Applications.
* Implement Natural Language Processing algorithm to interpret the collected data.
* Develop methodologies for protecting the computer system and applications developed.
* Test and validate the system and the deployment of information.

##### Scientific Goals
The goals set for the entire project are listed as follows:
* Crowd-Sensing architectures for monitoring opinions and environmental parameters generated by users in real time.
* Applications intelligent analysis of opinions collected from smartphone users.
* Cybersecurity transversal to the different layers of the crowd-sensing application.

### Methods and Materials
1. Software: Linux operating system. Free versions of the Linux operating system for PC were used.
2. MongoDB Server: A free Mongo server was used to create and access authenticated accounts.
3. GUI Dev Software: Graphical user interface development software (Flutter Framework). Software necessary for the graphic design of the widgets.
4. Android IDE: Android IDE with iOS, Windows, Linux, Web build-supports. Software to integrate different modules cross-platform.
5. Dart Compiler: Software to develop classes/widgets.
6. Personal computers: For Internet access, programming and implementation of the app and writing thesis and reports.
7. PyTorch Framework: To implement the language processing algorithm.
